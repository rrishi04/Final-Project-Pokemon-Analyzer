# Final-Project-Pokemon-Analyzer

Purpose of Study:
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on the pokemon data from paldea region (Scarlet/Violet). The dataset provides stats for pokemon, including their base stats, types, catch rates, and egg cycles. The goal is to analyze these values to find insights that can help players enhance their gameplay.

Questions: (I decided to use in my study)
1. What are the top 5 Pokémon with the highest total base stats?
2. What are the most common Pokémon in Scarlet/Violet based on catch rate?
3. What are the least common Pokémon based on catch rate?
4. Which Pokémon have the lowest egg cycles in this Paldea?


Files:
2024.csv: Normal CSV File, uncleaned data for the 2024 data. Altered and modified this CSV in order to make clean CSV files for the corresponding years.

.ipynb: This is my fill Jupyter notebook, it goes over everything from how I scraped my data parsed and collected date, then organized the data and cleaned it. I then display how I answer my questions using plots and graphs.
