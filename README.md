Purpose of Study:
This project's purpose is to preform data analysis on survey data from CCM. The survey provides data on the students who attended CCM and their "background" with their reason as to why they were influenced to join CCM. The goal is to provide an anaylsis to help the Computing department gain more enrollments. We are taskedd to use python to anaylze the data and create graphs to answer data driven questions. This quiestions will help the admission office in gaining a new perspective and giving them an idea on how to gain more computing enrollments. 

Questions: (I decided to use in my study)
1. What are the top 5 Pokémon with the highest total base stats?
2. What are the most common Pokémon in Scarlet/Violet based on catch rate?
3. What are the least common Pokémon based on catch rate?
4. Which Pokémon have the lowest egg cycles in this Paldea?


Files:
2024.csv: Normal CSV File, uncleaned data for the 2024 data. Altered and modified this CSV in order to make clean CSV files for the corresponding years.

.ipynb: This is my fill Jupyter notebook, it goes over everything from how I scraped my data parsed and collected date, then organized the data and cleaned it. I then display how I answer my questions using plots and graphs.
