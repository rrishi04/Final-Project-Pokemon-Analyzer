# Final-Project-Pokemon-Analyzer

Purpose of Study:
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on the pokemon data from paldea region (Scarlet/Violet). The dataset provides stats for pokemon, including their base stats, types, catch rates, and egg cycles. The goal is to analyze these values to find insights that can help players enhance their gameplay.

Questions: (I decided to use in my study)
1. What are the top 5 Pokémon with the highest total base stats?
2. What are the most common Pokémon in Scarlet/Violet based on catch rate?
3. What are the least common Pokémon based on catch rate?
4. Which Pokémon have the lowest egg cycles in this Paldea?


Files:
pokemon_scarlet_violet.csv: Cleaned CSV File of the Pokemons scraped from the PokemonDB site. This includes all the columns required to answer the questions.
